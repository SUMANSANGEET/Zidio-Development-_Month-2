##Personalized (Healthcare) Recommendation System 

Project Overview 
The Personalized Recommendation System leverages Machine Learning (ML) and 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide tailored suggestions to users based on their 
preferences, behaviors, and interactions. The system can be applied to various domains, 
including e-commerce, entertainment, education, and healthcare. 

Key Features:

1. Data Collection and User Management 
 User authentication & authorization (JWT-based login/signup) 
 Profile management with preferences & interests 
 Role-based access control (Admin, User, Analyst) 

2. Data Processing & Analytics 
 User activity tracking (clicks, searches, purchases, watch history, etc.) 
 Behavioral pattern analysis for personalized recommendations 
 Trend detection and real-time popularity rankings 

3. Recommendation Engine 
 Content-Based Filtering: Recommends items similar to user interests.
vectorizer=TfidfVectorizer
item_vectors=vectorizer.fit_transform

cosine_sim=cosine_similarity(item_vectors)

def recommend_items(item_id, num_recommendations=3) 

 Collaborative Filtering: Suggests based on similar users' choices. 
 Hybrid Filtering: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering. 
 Context-Aware Recommendations: Adjusts suggestions based on time, location, 
and trends. 
 Sentiment Analysis: Enhances recommendations by analyzing user reviews and 
feedback. 
 
4. Dashboard & Reporting 
 Interactive user analytics dashboard 
 Performance tracking of recommendation algorithms 
 Insights into user engagement and conversion rates 

5. AI & Machine Learning Models 
 Natural Language Processing (NLP): Processes textual reviews & feedback. 
 Deep Learning (Neural Networks): Enhances recommendation accuracy. 
 Graph-Based Recommendation: Uses knowledge graphs for better associations. 
 Reinforcement Learning: Adapts recommendations based on real-time user 
interactions

2 components in Recommendation:
a. Disease prediction model
X=medical_record['age','blood_pressure','glucose_level','heart_rate']
y=medical_record('diagnosis')

b. Medicine Recommendation Model
